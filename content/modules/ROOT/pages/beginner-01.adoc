== Goal

In this section, you'll get hands-on experience with the core components of the Llama Stack platform. This beginner series walks you through everything from starting the server to interacting with models using the CLI, playground, and Python SDK.

== Overview

This sections is broken into four beginner-friendly modules:

* xref:beginner-01-helloworld.adoc[Llama-stack Helloworld] +
  Learn how to run the Llama Stack server using a model served by Ollama and test it using the Llama Stack CLI. This is your first look at how the stack operates.

* xref:beginner-01-cli.adoc[Llama-stack CLI] +
  Explore how to interact with Llama Stack using the command-line interface. You'll learn how to list models, run inferences, and inspect responses directly from your terminal.

* xref:beginner-01-playground.adoc[Llama-stack Playground] +
  Use the Llama Stack playground to interact with a Llama Stack server.

* xref:beginner-01-python-programming.adoc[Llama-stack Python programming] +
  Go deeper into Python development with the Llama Stack SDK. This module covers an introduction to the Llama Stack python SDK.

== Next Step

Start with xref:beginner-01-helloworld.adoc[Llama-stack Helloworld] to launch your first Llama Stack instance and send a prompt using Python!
